# MATH137_VEDIO_DOWNLOAD_AUTOMATION
Welcome guys this is a simple project i built to automate my vedio download in math 137 files to my pc. If I manually do it , it takes me about 5 mins atleast. 5 minutes. Time is not the issue but it is boring especially i have 10 , 12 vedios to download. So i automated this process and does my work in 30 seconds
This is script not fully built by me. I got the idea from Stack overflows. Cediting them. Parts of the code was taken from there https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30953104/download-video-from-url-in-python
Parts of logic on how to traverse a pdf from https://automatetheboringstuff.com/
And rest I built on my own. I mean i had to refer these sources and then i was able to add on my code and finaly compiled the code.
This project might seem simple and it is. For guys who dont use vedios in 137 , i am not sure if it helps you or not but it might help in different lectures 
So i just combined and added few parts to actually make this more attractive
